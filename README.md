# sakurahud

just a backup for future reference or in case i need it on another machine,
therefore i will not be updating this hud with new features or customizations
however, i plan to add screenshots sometime in the near future

this hud is essentially a fork of cibahud, but ive added quite a few things that i dont want to push to actual cibahud
  these include: 
      using a different font
      glitchy low ammo from geass
      white killfeed icons
      new background
      

*IMPORTANT*
with no edits, this hud is meant to be used with cl_hud_minmode 1 and tf_use_match_hud 1
could be broken on some weapon combinations but it works for the ones i play on
